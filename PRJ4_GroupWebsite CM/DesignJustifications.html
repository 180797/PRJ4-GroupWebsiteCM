    <h2>Navigation flowchart</h2>
    <p>This is our Navigation flowchart. We wanted to keep our site simple, combining elements on pages.
    </p>
	<br> 
	  <img class="colorscheme" src="images/Color schemeAsset 4.png" alt="Color scheme image"/> 
	<h2>Color scheme</h2>
	   <p>This is our color scheme! We chose this when developing our Brand Road Map and decided to stick with it, because we like it a lot!</p>
	  <br> 
	  <h2>Fonts</h2>
	  <p>The chosen Google Fonts were 'Roboto', which is the font of paragraphs and 'Fjalla One' which is the font used as titles and for the quote on the homepage. We also used 'Mr Dafoe', cursive, for the name of quoted person.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>User Testing Report</h2>
	  <p>Like everyone else doing this assignment, we performed a user testing moment. We let our housemates, family members and friends take a look. We did not guide them, as we wanted to see them cruise through the site by themselves. Life doesn't always take you by the hand, and that also counts for visiting a new website ;) 
	  <br> 
	  <h4>Some testimonials</h4>
	  "Nice! Your site looks good, it's uncomplicated too! Maybe I would change the color of the font on your frontpage's 'learn' part." <br>
	  - Milot van Oorschot, Lisanne's housemate. <br> <br> 
	 Rodney, Dante's housemate, told us that he likes the colors because he thinks blue and green are “addicting” colors and according to him thats why whatsapp and facebook have these colors, he thinks it would be a better idea to put the about us section before the shop section so we can inform our customers about who we are before we sell stuff to them.  He noticed some spelling errors but he was overall. Pleased about the look. He liked our images and he thought everything was accessible. He looked at all of the pages we created and he thought the footer needed a copyright.
Overall he was positive about the website and its features. <br><br> 
	  Kim, a friend of Dante: She really liked the icons we created and she was very excited about the feel of the page. Although she noticed that some text was in a color that looked a bit off from the other colors used on the homepage. <br> <br>
	  Jolijn, a housemate from Lisanne liked the site. She did suggest maybe adding a contact page. <br> <br> 
	   <h4>Adjusting</h4>
	  After all this feedback, we decided to change the color of the learn part, that Milot mentioned. We also rechecked the spelling. We decided against adding a contact page.
